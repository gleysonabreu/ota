### About the project

This project was carried out in two stages.

In the first stage, a Next.js website was built to generate and encrypt passwords, offering options for letters and symbols, resulting in a combination of words to create a password. Encryption options include MD5, SHA-1, and BCRYPT, as well as sending passwords to an email.

In the second part of the project, a system was developed using Fastify to send emails containing the generated passwords.
